# Bread

This is the site for my band, The Wonder Bars, open-sourced in all its glory. You can see it running on <http://thewonderbars.com>. The app is called `Bread` (get it? wonder bread?), and its unique feature is that it does not require local storage for basically anything. Bread pulls its informational data from Facebook, music from Soundcloud, photos from Flickr, and news from Tumblr. Bread is an all-in-one electronic press kit, all you have to do is plug in your own design and call the attributes from your page in `routes.rb`. With no configuration, Bread will pull any piece of data from your Facebook page or profile that you explicitly request in the routes file.
