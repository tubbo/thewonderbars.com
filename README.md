# The Wonder Bars

This is the site for my band, The Wonder Bars. It's open sourced here in
all its glory, all you have to do is edit `database.yml` and
`facebook.yml`. The unique feature about this site is that it does not
store a lot of local content, it pulls most of its content from Facebook
and Soundcloud. The only thing that it stores locally are users (for
administration) and releases, which contain a full discography of the
band's musical exports, for which it uses PostgreSQL. One can
concievably route any vanity URL to a Facebook attribute in `routes.rb`.

## Roadmap

- Install ActiveAdmin to manage releases.

## Contributors

- Tom Scott, development
- Jules Victor, logo design
